Features I have implemented in my To-Do List app

1. **Adding Tasks:**
   Users can add tasks by typing in the input box and clicking the "Add" button.

2. **Priority Selection:**
   Users can select the priority of the tasks using a dropdown menu with options: High, Medium, and Low.

3. **Task List Display:**
   Added tasks are displayed in a list format, along with their priority dropdown and a delete icon.

4. **Checkbox and Strikethrough:**
   Users can click on a task to toggle a checkbox, and checked tasks are visually marked with a strikethrough.

5. **Deleting Tasks:**
   Users can delete a task by clicking the delete icon (âœ–).

6. **Local Storage:**
   The added tasks are stored in the browser's local storage, so they persist even after refreshing the page.

7. **Footer with Social Icons:**
   The footer displays your app's copyright information and includes social icons linked to your LinkedIn, GitHub, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram profiles.

8. **Responsive Design:**
   The app is designed to be responsive and adapts to different screen sizes, with adjustments made for screens up to 768px wide.
